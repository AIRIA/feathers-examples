# Minimal Theme for Foxhole

A [Foxhole for Starling](https://github.com/joshtynjala/foxhole-starling) theme based on the appearance of [MinimalComps](http://minimalcomps.com/), another great set of Flash user interface components. Special thanks to [Keith Peters](http://bit-101.com/) for his original design and for giving permission to create this theme for Foxhole.
